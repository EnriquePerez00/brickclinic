                "question": "Do you get the original minifigures for the sets?",

                "question": "Do I have to send the sets disassembled?",

But if you send them together, we also like disassembling LEGO® and will do it for you. If some pieces cannot be separated (glue?, torsion?, semi-worn plastic?), we will leave them aside and return them."

                "question": "What can I expect to get from my LEGO® boxes?",
                "answer": "There are multiple factors that affect the number, variety, and cost of the sets we can recover. An 80% complete set is cheaper to rebuild than a 50% one. Also, if it is from 'bestseller' series like Star Wars™, LEGO® City, or LEGO® Technic, there is more volume and better spare part pricing than in niche series."

                "question": "What kind of designs do you propose with my pieces?",
                "answer": "It depends on the variety and theme of your pieces. With several semi-complete sets of the same theme, we can suggest sets and new creations from the same series, and we will have more options than with a drawer of 2x2 and 3x3 bricks in blue, white, and red. The fewer set series you mix the better, and the more variety of pieces the better."

                "question": "Is your process safe for children with allergies?",

                "question": "Does the process damage LEGO® pieces?",
